# BlizFlow: Neural Stealth OS Master Guide

## Welcome to BlizFlow
BlizFlow is a high-performance neural rewriting engine designed to inject human-like variance and rhythm into machine-generated content. Unlike basic paraphrasers, BlizFlow rebuilds text from the semantic foundation to shatter AI detection patterns.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. Burstiness
Natural human writing is inconsistent. Humans mix short, punchy sentences with long, complex, and sometimes rambling thoughts. BlizFlow mimics this "burstiness" by dynamically altering sentence structures and lengths, ensuring the text doesn't have the static, rhythmic pulse of an AI generator.

### 2. Neural Shadowing
AI detectors look for high "predictability" in token sequences. Neural Shadowing is our proprietary method of injecting low-probability (but contextually accurate) word choices and human-like "noise" that effectively hides the predictable fingerprints of large language models.

### 3. Semantic Replay
Instead of swapping words, BlizFlow performs a "Semantic Replay." It analyzes the core meaning and facts of your source text, then re-imagines how an expert human (in your chosen tone) would explain those exact same facts from scratch.

## ⚖️ Ethical Guidelines
BlizFlow is a tool for **enhancement**, not deception.
- Always review and add your final personal touch to the output.
- Be transparent about AI assistance in academic or professional environments.
- Use the technology to elevate your voice and bypass technical hurdles, not to create low-value spam.
