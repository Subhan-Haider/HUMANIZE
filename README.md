## 📌 Project Overview
**BlizFlow AI** is a premium neural steering engine designed to protect the integrity of human writing. Developed by **Subhan Haider**, it uses multi-pass linguistic shattering and "Ghost Stealth" technology to ensure your voice remains undetectable by even the most aggressive AI classifiers.

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **Neural Stealth Writing**: Uses multi-pass LLM rewriting (Shadow Rewrite) to break AI patterns.
✅ **Ghost Stealth Technology**: Injects invisible Unicode markers to shatter AI tokenization without changing visible text.
✅ **Advanced Humanization Levels**: Select from 5 levels of stealth, including the "NUCLEAR" mode for 3.15b bypass.
✅ **Professional Persona**: Tailors output for different audiences (Business, Academic, Technical).
✅ **Concise & Accurate**: Unlike other humanizers, BlizFlow AI preserves your original meaning without added "fluff."
✅ **BlizFlow Web Interface**: A premium, minimalist SaaS dashboard for a seamless user experience.
